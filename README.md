## Social Determinants of Health and Complete Tooth Loss

### Introduction

This is a repository for my academic project/working paper on complete tooth loss (CTL) and social determinants of health (SDOH) among U.S. Counties. This project was born out of an academic assignment in the advanced epidemiology course taught by Dr. Min Tao at Michigan State University. This project's abstract has been accepted for oral presentation at the American Public Health Association's Annual Meeting in October of 2024. This repository will house the scripts used to run and analyze the project's data, as well as the slides for the presentation. This is in an effort to show full transparency and reproducability.
